# Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS)

STRIPS is the first major planning system which combines techniques from state-space search, theorem proving and control theory [1, 2]. It represents states as a collection of first-order predicate formulas, and finds a sequence of operators which transform the initial state to the goal state. While the algorithm behind STRIPS is a milestone, the action representation of STRIPS was far more influential -- Most planning systems following it have used a variant of the STRIPS language.
